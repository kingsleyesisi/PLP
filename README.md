#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 

**Software Engineering is the act of designing, maintaining, testing and developong softwares, 
it is important in the technology industry because software engineering is like the arcitecture of building software and without there won't been good softwares in the insustry**

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
1. Software development
2. software testing
3. requirement analysis and gathering 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Planning: This requires the software developer to draft out plans about the project 
- Requirements analysis: This involve information gathering about the project at hand
- Design: Create architectural designs and system models.
- Implementation (Coding): Developers write code based on design documents.
- Testing: Perform unit testing, integration testing, system testing
- Deployment: Release the software to production.
- Maintenance & Support: Monitor performance, fix issues, and release updates.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
**Use Waterfall when requirements are fixed, and the project is predictable.
Use Agile when requirements are dynamic, and flexibility is essential.**

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. The roles of a software developer is to develope the software or write code
2. the role of a Quality Asurance Engineer is to ensure quality code and do code review before being pushed to production
3. the projec tmanager is the person incharge of the project
   

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
**IDEs are Coding and workspace enviroment for software engineering and examples are (Pycharm: Python, Visual Studio: C++) and VSCode which is a text editor but can also serve as a IDE
Version Controls System is neccessery to keep track of all the changes made in the code base eg. git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Common Challenges Faced by Software Engineers & Solutions
Challenge	Solution
Debugging Complex Code	Use proper logging, debugging tools, and unit tests. Break down code into smaller, testable units.
Managing Large Codebases	Use modular programming, clear documentation, and an efficient VCS like Git.
Meeting Deadlines	Use Agile methodologies, prioritize tasks, and communicate effectively with the team.
Keeping Up with Technology Trends	Engage in continuous learning through courses, open-source contributions, and tech communities.
Security Risks	Follow best security practices, conduct code reviews, and use automated security testing tools.
Handling Scope Creep	Define clear project requirements and follow an iterative approach (Agile) to manage evolving needs.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Types of Software Testing & Their Importance
Unit Testing

Definition: Tests individual components or functions in isolation.
Importance: Catches errors early, ensures small pieces of code work as expected.
Example: Testing a login function to ensure correct username-password validation.
Integration Testing

Definition: Tests interactions between multiple modules or services.
Importance: Ensures that integrated components work together correctly.
Example: Checking if a payment system correctly communicates with a bank API.
System Testing

Definition: Tests the complete system to ensure all features function properly.
Importance: Validates that the software meets all functional and non-functional requirements.
Example: Testing an entire e-commerce website, from browsing to checkout.
Acceptance Testing

Definition: Ensures the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.
Importance: Confirms that the software delivers value to users.
Example: A client testing a newly developed CRM system before approving deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing text-based inputs (prompts) to guide AI models in generating more accurate and useful responses.

Importance: Enhances the quality of AI-generated outputs.
Reduces the need for manual corrections and follow-up prompts.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about cars."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain the differences between electric and gasoline-powered cars, including their environmental impact, cost, and performance."

Why is the improved prompt better?
✅ More specific – Focuses on a clear comparison.
✅ Concise – Removes unnecessary ambiguity.
✅ Targeted output – Guides the AI to generate structured, useful information.
